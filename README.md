## üìê Project Overview

- **Client:** A 30-employee law firm specializing in corporate legal services
- **Objectives:**
  - Design secure infrastructure for sensitive legal documents
  - Meet GDPR compliance for European clients
  - Implement robust backup and recovery strategies
  - Ensure reliable uptime with redundancy and failover systems
- **Constraints:** $100,000 budget, data encryption in transit and at rest, limited IT staffing

## üåê VLAN Design

| VLAN | Purpose            | Access Rules |
|------|--------------------|--------------|
| 10   | Legal Department   | Access to VLANs 40, 50 |
| 20   | Non-Legal Dept.    | Access to VLANs 40, 50, limited 60 |
| 30   | IT Department      | Full access to all VLANs |
| 40   | Servers & Printer  | Accessible by VLAN 10/20/50/60 with RBAC. VLAN 30(IT) = full access |
| 50   | Wi-Fi Access Points| Managed by VLAN 30 |
| 60   | Security Cameras   | Read-only access by VLAN 20 receptionist and full access by VLAN 30(IT) |
